            While rice is cooking, grind peanuts in a blender and set aside. Heat the margarine in a skillet over medium
            heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned golden brown about 10
            minutes. Stir in ginger, carrots, and salt to taste. Reduce heat to low and cover to steam 5 minutes. Stir
            in cayenne pepper and peanuts. When rice is done, add it to skillet and stir gently to combine with other
